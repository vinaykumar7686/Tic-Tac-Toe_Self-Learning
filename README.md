# Tic-Tac-Toe_Self-Learning
This is a self learning version of tic-tac-toe that learns from its failures, and tries not to repeat them in order to win in next match.
Developed by me while I was under J2SE and MYSQL training a year back. 

This application is based on Java SE and was developed by using NetBeans IDE and uses MySQL as database.

A Year back, I was under training where I was being taught how to use Java as front-end and MySql as back-end for desktop application development,
but I was keen intrested in learning machine learning and AI but didn't know how to implement it. 
But I decided to make an application that can learn something on its own with my present knowledge, hence came an idea and I recreated this game.
